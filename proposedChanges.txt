	rename "eat" to "digest"
X	add double resource field to Cell.java
X	^^just have regular getter/setter methods for this. the "growth over time" effect will be handled by the simulation/bact classes

X	normal.rvgs

X	Also add field time_last_depleted
X	initialize cell resources with resource ~ Normal(mu, sd^2)
X	add agent.starve method, but only offer implementation for bacteria. This seems bad, but hey. It's how we decided to implement our next-event calendar, and we're not changing that now.
X	Bact.starve(bacList):
X	    unoccupy Cell[row][col]
X	    remove (this) from bacList
	    garbageCollector should handle the rest
