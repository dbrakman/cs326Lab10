rename "eat" to "digest"
add double resource field to Cell.java
^^just have regular getter/setter methods for this. the "growth over time" effect will be handled by the simulation/bact classes

normal.rvgs

Also add field time_last_depleted
initialize cell resources with resource ~ Normal(mu, sd^2)
add agent.starve method, but only offer implementation for bacteria. This seems bad, but hey. It's how we decided to implement our next-event calendar, and we're not changing that now.
Bact.starve(bacList):
    unoccupy Cell[row][col]
    remove (this) from bacList
    garbageCollector should handle the rest
update move() and divide() methods per handout
